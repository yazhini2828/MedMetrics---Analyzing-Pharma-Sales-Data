# PHARMA SALES ANALYSIS

The analysis of a dataset that has the details of medicine sales and production for different varieties is done in this project. 

Initially we have calculated the ANOVA table, both one-way and two-way since the dataset has data for variety of medicines.
Under one-way ANOVA multiple pairwise comparison tests are carried out such as a small technique to find the quantity index numbers for the data is also used. 

To check for any differences, present between the sales for two years, non-parametric tests are implemented.
Under that, binomial test is used to calculate the percentage of effect and no effect between the two years of data. Another vital method, Wilcoxon rank sum test is used to check whether the means of both the data are significantly different or not.

S chart and x bar charts are implemented to see whether the data is under control or not. Finally, Trend line is fitted to the data and the linear equation is obtained. Hence the end of our project.
